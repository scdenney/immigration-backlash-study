# Fairness or Threat? Understanding Sources of Immigration Backlash in Democracies

## Project Overview

Immigration has become one of the most contentious political issues in democracies today, generating significant public backlash and policy instability. Scholarly debate has largely centered on two competing explanations for immigration attitudes: group threat theory (dominant groups react defensively when immigration threatens cultural identity, national character, or established social hierarchies) and economic competition theory (attitudes driven by perceived individual economic threats like job competition, or sociotropic concerns about national economic impacts). However, recent work by Levy and Wright (2020) on American attitudes toward immigration introduces a third perspective: "civic fairness" – the idea that publics (Americans, in this case) evaluate immigration through moral principles of legal compliance and equal opportunity, potentially overriding both group-based concerns and economic calculations. Levy and Wright argue that civic fairness is rooted in distinctly American legal, normative, and institutional expectations. This project asks whether that logic resonates elsewhere, or whether the U.S. is truly exceptional.

This project uses experimental surveys across the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Singapore to provide a unique, systematic cross-national test of whether civic fairness represents a distinct driver of immigration attitudes.

**Keywords**: Immigration attitudes, public opinion, comparative politics, experimental research, policy analysis

## Central Research Questions

- **Do fairness perceptions drive immigration attitudes across different countries?**
- **How do fairness considerations interact with cultural and economic concerns?**
- **How do publics respond to perceived failures of immigration control, and does civic fairness mediate this backlash?**
- **What are the implications for sustainable immigration policy?**

## Methodology

**Comparative Experimental Design**: Online surveys with approximately 2,000 respondents per country, using vignette experiments that present immigration policy scenarios requiring trade-offs between different priorities.

**Case Selection**: Four countries (three democracies, plus one hybrid regime) chosen to represent different contemporary challenges to democratic immigration governance:
- **United States**: Asylum system overwhelmed by massive case backlogs and relaxed enforcement, raising questions about procedural fairness and institutional capacity
- **Germany**: Tensions between humanitarian obligations and democratic control, with citizens questioning whether supranational human rights interpretations undermine national sovereignty  
- **South Korea**: Non-Western democracy where immigration challenges traditional ethnic homogeneity assumptions, testing whether fairness principles operate beyond Western contexts
- **Singapore**: Electoral authoritarian regime with high levels of labor migration and state-led meritocratic integration narratives, offering a critical contrast to test how civic fairness operates in a non-democratic but high-capacity setting

## Timeline & Outputs

**Duration**: 12 months (2025-26)

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Academic publication in a peer-reviewed journal
- Policy brief for immigration policymakers
- Public engagement through media and conferences

## Significance

Understanding the psychological and political drivers of immigration attitudes can help:
- Design more effective and sustainable immigration policies
- Reduce immigration-related social tensions and polarization
- Inform democratic approaches to managing immigration challenges
