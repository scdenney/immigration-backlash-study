# Fairness or Threat? Understanding Sources of Immigration Backlash in Democracies

**A Comparative Study of Immigration Attitudes Across Four Countries**

## Project Overview

Immigration has become one of the most contentious political issues in democracies today, generating significant public backlash and policy instability. Scholarly debate has largely centered on two competing explanations for immigration attitudes: group threat theory (dominant groups react defensively when immigration threatens cultural identity, national character, or established social hierarchies) and economic competition theory (attitudes driven by perceived individual economic threats like job competition, or sociotropic concerns about national economic impacts). However, recent work by Levy and Wright (2020) introduced a third perspective: "civic fairness" – the idea that Americans evaluate immigration through moral principles of legal compliance and equal opportunity, potentially overriding both group-based concerns and economic calculations.

This research project builds on and extends the civic fairness framework by examining whether fairness perceptions override group threat and economic considerations across different democratic contexts. Do publics support immigration policies they perceive as fair even when they challenge cultural boundaries or impose economic costs? Do they oppose immigration they see as unfair even when it benefits the national economy? And do these fairness-based moral judgments operate similarly across countries with different institutional arrangements and immigration histories?

Using experimental surveys across the United States, Canada, Germany, and South Korea, this project provides the first systematic cross-national test of whether civic fairness represents a distinct and potent driver of immigration attitudes that transcends group threat and economic competition.

## Central Research Questions

- **Do fairness perceptions drive immigration attitudes across different countries?**
- **How do fairness considerations interact with cultural and economic concerns?**
- **What are the implications for sustainable immigration policy?**

## Methodology

**Comparative Experimental Design**: Online surveys with approximately 2,000 respondents per country, using vignette experiments that present policy scenarios requiring trade-offs between different priorities.

**Case Selection**: Four democracies chosen to represent different challenges to democratic immigration governance:
- **United States**: Asylum system overwhelmed by massive case backlogs and relaxed enforcement, raising questions about procedural fairness and institutional capacity
- **Germany**: Tensions between humanitarian obligations and democratic control, with citizens questioning whether supranational human rights interpretations undermine national sovereignty  
- **Canada**: Historically successful multicultural model facing new strains from rapid immigration increases and housing/service pressures
- **South Korea**: Non-Western democracy where immigration challenges traditional ethnic homogeneity assumptions, testing whether fairness principles operate beyond Western contexts

## Timeline & Outputs

**Duration**: 12 months (2025-26)

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Academic publications in peer-reviewed journals
- Policy brief for immigration policymakers
- Public engagement through media and conferences

## Significance

Understanding the psychological and political drivers of immigration attitudes can help:
- Design more effective and sustainable immigration policies
- Reduce immigration-related social tensions and polarization
- Inform democratic approaches to managing immigration challenges
